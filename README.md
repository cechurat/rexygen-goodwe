# Rexygen GoodWe Driver

Welcome to the REXYGEN GoodWe Git repository! This repository contains a REXYGEN project that enables communication with GoodWe inverters, specifically the GW10K-ET Plus model, via RS485 at the EMS connector.

REXYGEN is a powerful platform for control and automation, and this project provides an easy and efficient way to communicate with GoodWe inverters for monitoring and control purposes. The project has been tested with the GW10K-ET Plus inverter, but it can be adapted to work with other GoodWe inverters as well.

If you're interested in controlling and monitoring GoodWe inverters using REXYGEN, this repository is a great starting point.
